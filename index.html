Okay, so here's some little update from me after 2 months, which could only be explained by some serious procrastination, similar as why I did my taxes today. 
Now I realized that I should actually do something here and record it. 
I've got some ideas, simple or silly maybe, but let's actually start working on it.<br />
Let me try to keep this page plain like so, before I decide whether I should learn to blog by Jekyll. <br />

So I've finally decided to do a blog on GitHub. Hope it'll be a rewarding experience among other things. <br />
Happy Valentine!
